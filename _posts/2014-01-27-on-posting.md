I often think about writing more on this here internet, but quickly dismiss the idea, thinking that what’s on my mind is trivial and obvious and of use to no one. Lately I’ve been considering the type of people who would actually read any of the content I’m ever likely to post and my opinion has changed: if you’re reading this you might find stuff I’m implementing in my projects new, interesting or at least vaguely applicable. It doesn’t have to be ground breaking and it might just inspire someone to try a different approach to their development.
With that in mind I’m going to endeavour to post more, starting with the thing that will follow shortly!
