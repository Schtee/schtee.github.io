So I've joined the [GitHub Pages](http://github.io)/[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) revolution - I've ditched WordPress in favour of a git based workflow, writing simple Markdown documents to create posts. Hopefully the decreased friction in writing posts will actually encourage me to write things. I'm writing this in GitHub's [Atom](http://atom.io) editor, to then use git to commit and push it to GitHub and it feels like git is pervading every element of my life!

I threw together some HTML/CSS based on the default Jekyll page and this is what happened. It looks like a sedate Geocities page and I love it. Retro-functional-chique.
