title: PortMaster Releases RSS Feed
---
I love me an open handheld games console and I love playing games on them which were never intended to be, so I love [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games/faq.html#what-is-portmaster). I don't like _having to do stuff_, such as keeping tabs on which games have been ported. So I threw together [a little project](https://github.com/Schtee/portmaster-rss) to scrape the [PortMaster releases JSON](https://github.com/PortsMaster/PortMaster-Info/blob/main/ports.json) and generate an RSS feed I (and you) can subscribe to and keep track of releases as they happen. The feed lives here [https://ste.vet/portmaster-rss/feed.xml](https://ste.vet/portmaster-rss/feed.xml) and is updated at 2:22 (🤷) every day.
