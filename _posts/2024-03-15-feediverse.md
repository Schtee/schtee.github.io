> What if we had a great experience that ties together both short-form discussion and re-sharing and long-form reading, in a way that better showcases both kinds of content and realizes that the way we consume both is different? What if it had a beautiful, commercial-level design? And what if it remained tied to the open social web at its core, and pushed the capabilities of the protocols forward as it released new features and discovered new user needs?

I've had an idea rattling around in my head for a while. The idea of a Fediversey RSS reader and read later platform. Each RSS feed would be an "account" you can follow/share, and then a nice client to save off articles for later and add highlights/annotations to share. If I had Ben's year and funding, I'd do that!
