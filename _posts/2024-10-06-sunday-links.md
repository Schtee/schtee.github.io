- [Getting my daily news from a dot matrix printer - Andrew Schmelyun](https://aschmelyun.com/blog/getting-my-daily-news-from-a-dot-matrix-printer/) via [Ben Werdmuller](https://werd.io/2024/getting-my-daily-news-from-a-dot-matrix-printer) - we had (old) printers like this in the home growing up and there would be something very nostalgic about reading a daily roundup on dot matrix paper
- [DOOM ported to run almost entirely on AMD GPUs - GamingOnLinux](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/doom-ported-to-run-almost-entirely-on-amd-gpus/) - don't waste your spare GPUs mining crypto or generating derivative artwork- play Doom instead! More importantly, today I learnt that LLVM can compile C++ to run on the GPU, via [AMDGPU](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html) and [NVPTX](https://llvm.org/docs/NVPTXUsage.html) backends.
