          <h2>Dirty Haxe</h2>
<p class="meta">08 Aug 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I&#39;m working on my first ever <a href="http://www.haxe.org">Haxe</a> project and I am loving it. Haxe is a free, open source, object-oriented, cross platform, multi-target, ActionScript-like language and compiler. From one project you can generate:
* a compiled SWF, with support for a bunch of Flash versions
* JavaScript
* PHP
* C#, for targeting Windows,Windows Phone, Xbox or anything Mono supports
* Java, for targeting Android or anything that runs the JVM
* C++, for targeting basically anything else</p>

<p>Apart from SWF these will all provide source code which can then be built in an environment of your choosing.</p>

<h2>What about making games?</h2>

<p>For me, the real magic comes with the OpenFL library - an open source, cross platform implementation of the Flash standard library. This gives you access to a complete, well documented node based view hierarchy that can target basically anything. From the same project, using a different build argument, OpenFL can build to run in browser using HTML5 or Flash; natively on Windows, Mac and Linux desktop; on mobile, with support for iOS, Android and BlackBerry. This means you can hedge your bets when targeting browser: don&#39;t want to worry about flakey HTML5 support? Provide it as an option, but also build a SWF for everybody else. There&#39;s always going to be discrepancy between hardware and screen resolutions available on different mobile devices, but that doesn&#39;t mean you need different code. Build support for different resolutions into your game and target standard hardware features and your game can run on anything.</p>

<h2>The language</h2>

<p>So it can build a game to run on your toaster, but how is it to actually use? Well, for a start it has a compiler, so you know ahead of execution that your local variable is being used without being assigned. It&#39;s strictly typed, so that same compiler can catch you assigning a String to an Int. It also makes good use of type inference so you still don&#39;t have to be too verbose with assignment. It supports generics for some sweet strictly-typed containers. It supports anonymous functions and function objects for super-convenient callbacks. It&#39;s got a thorough standard library with support for sockets, web requests, XML parsing, functional-style set manipulation and a bunch more. The standard library support varies depending on what&#39;s actually available on different platforms, but that&#39;s all covered in the <a href="http://api.haxe.org/">API docs</a>. I haven&#39;t had to touch too much of it for the project I&#39;ve been working on, but the hash map implementation has served me well. Compile times are an oft-quoted boon of Haxe, and from my limited experience it seems great. My MacBook Air generates the JS target for my simple puzzle games in 2-3 seconds.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve struggled a little bit with debugging but that&#39;s mainly a result of targeting HTML5. The JavaScript debugger in Firefox is great but you&#39;re debugging a single monolithic JS file which is a different representation of your Haxe code, and then figuring out what  that actually translates to. I&#39;ll have to explore further if there&#39;s a way to debug something closer to the actual game code I wrote, ideally the Haxe code itself. Declarations are ECMAScript style, <code>name:Type</code> (e.g. <code>var x:Int</code>), which I find a little off-putting as I spend most of my time in C-like languages, but I can cope!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.unity3d.com">Unity</a> extensively, both at work and at home, and it&#39;s perfect for making cross-platform 3D games, making heavy use of the concept of scenes. I&#39;ve made a few 2D games in Unity and it always feels like I&#39;m fighting against it, shoehorning 2D elements into a 3D workflow. Haxe with OpenFL seems like a great code-centric alternative to Unity - you get all the benefits of write-once, deploy anywhere, plus the whole Flash standard library to drive your game&#39;s sprites. I&#39;ll definitely be using it for any small 2D games I make in the near future. Also having the option of targeting Flash is a nice bonus few other cross platform solutions still support!</p>
